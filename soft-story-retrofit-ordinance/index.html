As a solution was sought, it was discovered that, by retrofitting the ground floor only, this probability goes down to 10%. Additionally, the retrofit costs are a very small fraction of the total cost of rebuilding the building, to say nothing of what would happen to the overall local economy if that many residents were suddenly displaced. And of course tenants don’t pay rent on apartments that they are unable to occupy.","length":552,"language":"en","measurementVersion":16,"measurementHash":"e0af8749e61396267da18de8851a828c"},{"id":"3d8704a1-275a-47fe-9b5e-98126f4e894c","item":"794edb00-c944-490a-a903-3d44f376b1fe","type":"image","html":"<img src=\"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7cc2a2d0-a6e0-4ca8-a620-c2953c6c6424.gif\">","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"keywords":[],"description":"","datePublished":null,"dateModified":null,"user":"c0e719b6-eeea-419a-8099-4be2fd892b35","source":"794edb00-c944-490a-a903-3d44f376b1fe","authors":[],"publisher":{"name":null,"domain":null,"url":null,"favicon":null},"starred":true},"cover":{"exif":{},"rotation":0,"colors":[[53,76,108],[193,200,206],[93,129,160],[26,53,90],[252,255,255]],"faces":[],"width":100,"height":95,"orientation":"landscape","ratio":"20:19","aspect":1.0526315789473684,"imgflosrc":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7b0bf8ab897764e2630933eabf21b9a973cfa1a3.gif","saliency":{"bounding_rect":[[7,34],[50,57]],"confidence":0.759144,"center":[29,46],"radius":22.8671},"original":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7cc2a2d0-a6e0-4ca8-a620-c2953c6c6424.gif","src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/55418c993ea1aa323d2ceeff0109cf8f/noop.gif?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F7b0bf8ab897764e2630933eabf21b9a973cfa1a3.gif","animated":false},"measurementHash":"a8404258e38a4131d2d2b88e0ec422b7","measurementVersion":16},{"id":"feb88d67-91ca-44b6-88b4-81742b302492","item":"794edb00-c944-490a-a903-3d44f376b1fe","type":"h3","html":"<h3></h3>","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"keywords":[],"description":"","datePublished":null,"dateModified":null,"user":"c0e719b6-eeea-419a-8099-4be2fd892b35","source":"794edb00-c944-490a-a903-3d44f376b1fe","authors":[],"publisher":{"name":null,"domain":null,"url":null,"favicon":null}},"src":null,"measurementHash":"00e36a8aa29457a40ec2299bd0f73c6e","text":"","length":0,"measurementVersion":16},{"id":"d68c396a-888c-4693-b0f6-8f7c353cc29d","item":"794edb00-c944-490a-a903-3d44f376b1fe","type":"h3","html":"<h3><p data-grid-id=\"43f6f104-7e35-4904-9639-acfb670e13ab\"></p></h3>","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"keywords":[],"description":"","datePublished":null,"dateModified":null,"authors":[],"publisher":{"name":null,"domain":null,"url":null,"favicon":null},"user":"c0e719b6-eeea-419a-8099-4be2fd892b35","source":"794edb00-c944-490a-a903-3d44f376b1fe"},"src":null,"text":"","length":0,"measurementVersion":15,"measurementHash":"c21014d22f32a9a02e13748c95c41782"},{"id":"0a914772-763f-4e62-ace9-dd285bb733f7","item":"794edb00-c944-490a-a903-3d44f376b1fe","type":"h3","html":"<h3>Who we are:</h3>","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"keywords":[],"description":"","datePublished":null,"dateModified":null,"authors":[],"publisher":{"name":null,"domain":null,"url":null,"favicon":null},"user":"c0e719b6-eeea-419a-8099-4be2fd892b35","source":"794edb00-c944-490a-a903-3d44f376b1fe"},"src":null,"text":"Who we are:","length":11,"measurementVersion":16,"measurementHash":"2114f149c444b645fb61492493009f0f"},{"id":"90467cc9-da20-4211-bdb0-f2ebc4ff5994","item":"794edb00-c944-490a-a903-3d44f376b1fe","type":"text","html":"<p>We are passionate about making San Francisco more resilient; ensuring that our city will be up-and-running as soon as possible after a major seismic event.

We know that dedicating proper attention on the front end may result in a higher initial design fee but it will allow for “right sizing” the project from the outset. Ultimately, this will eliminate the risk of over-engineering, poor coordination and inflated construction costs, delivering optimum value for the resources invested. Most importantly, once the inevitable earthquake strikes and building performance is tested, performance will be up to par.","length":784,"language":"en","measurementVersion":16,"measurementHash":"e380332a4f3a6b9dfa9ad34677c63cd4"},{"id":"25420e8f-fab7-49d9-9a97-8668e700fa2e","item":"794edb00-c944-490a-a903-3d44f376b1fe","type":"text","html":"<p>It is important to note that sometimes owners believe a building permit is all they need to get started on retrofitting these buildings without the participation of a licensed engineer.

This couldn’t be further from the truth. Engineers are trained to design individual building elements and the building code provides formulas to guide the work. When strengthening an existing building, however, it is critical to understand and work with the present strength of the original structure. Even if the original elements do not conform to the current code it is essential to provide the exact right amount of additional strength, stiffness and ductility to make the best of the existing structure. This is an art and a science learned through years of practice. Academic experience alone does not provide a full view into the situation. You cannot design a retrofit as you would a new building.
