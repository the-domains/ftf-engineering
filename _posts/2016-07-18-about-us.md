FTF Engineering is a structural engineering design firm serving clients throughout the greater San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Coast. With offices in San Francisco and San Luis Obispo, our team of highly qualified structural engineers collaborates with project stakeholders to create innovative and efficient structural designs, provide clear construction documentation, and support construction implementation.

We consider engineering as a means to accomplish a client's objectives. We enjoy a collaborative design process with architects and builders, together finding unique structural solutions -- whether the building is a cancer research lab or a family's dream home.

FTF is a growing and dynamic firm. Over the past year we have expanded our reach significantly and doubled in size. Our website is currently under construction. Please check in again soon to learn more about new initiatives and recent developments.
